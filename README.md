# Granutron
A real time granular synthesis external object for Pure Data coded in C++ using the Flext library https://grrrr.org/research/software/flext/.

The MP3 file is an example of what the external could do when it was compiled and used in a PD patch.

Originally written in 2004 for a university project. It worked very well and I was quite proud of it.
